What is FogFlow
--------------------

.. note:: FogFlow is a distributed execution framework to support dynamic processing flows over cloud and edges. 
		It can dynamically and automatically composite multiple NGSI-based data processing tasks 
		to form high level IoT services, and then orchestrate and optimize the deployment of those services
		within a shared cloud-edge environment, with regards to the availability, locality, and mobility of IoT devices.
