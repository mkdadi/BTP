Build all components from the source code
=========================================

FogFlow can be build and installed on Linux for both ARM and X86 processors (32bits and 64bits). 

Install dependencies
--------------------

#. To build FogFlow, first install the following dependencies.

	- install git client: please follow the instruction at https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-16-04
	
	- install docker engine: please follow the instruction at https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04
	
		.. note:: all the scripts are prepared under the assumption that you can run docker without sudo.
	

	- install the latest version of golang(>v1.9): please download and install it according to the information at https://golang.org/doc/install

	- install nodejs(>6.11) and npm (>3.10): please download and install them according to the information at https://nodejs.org/en/download/


#. To check the installed version


	.. code-block:: bash

		go version   #output  go version go1.9 linux/amd64 
  		nodejs -v    #output 	v6.10.2
  		npm -v       #output  3.10.10


#. To set the environment variable GOPATH


	.. note:: GOPATH defines the workspace for your go-based projects. Please note that the go workspace folder must have a "src" folder and your fogflow code repository must be cloned into this "src" folder. 
		For example, assume that your home folder is "/home/smartfog" and then you create a new folder "go" as your workspace. 
		In this case, you must create a "src" (must be exactly this name) under "/home/smartfog/go" first 
		and then check out the FogFlow code repository within the "/home/smartfog/go/src" folder.

	.. code-block:: bash	

		export GOPATH="/home/smartfog/go"


#. To check out the code repository

	.. code-block:: bash	
		
		cd /home/smartfog/go/src/	
		git clone https://github.com/smartfog/fogflow.git
		
		
#. To build all components from the source code as below
